Decentralized voting application for elections.  :ballot_box: ​ 

University senior project.



Voting for anything is one of the most important ways to ensure fair representation and equal voice when making decisions. The larger the implications for each decision, the more people who participate in the process. As such, it can become difficult to accurately and efficiently keep track of each voter’s eligibility and legitimacy to participate. On top of this, there are also other issues including lack of transparency and potential corruption which discourages many from voting at all.

We can ensure full transparency by integrating blockchain systems to the way that we vote.
